# Keylogger

### This script was made as a proof of concept, I have no sinister intentions with it

# How it works:
- 1: Change the **HOST** and **PORT** constants in `client.py`, so that it will point to your machine.
- 2: Run `server.py` on your machine.
- 3: Put and run `client.py` on the victims machine if pip and packages are installed. If not, just run `run.sh`.
- 4: Wait for the victim to type something whilst the script is running...

# Libraries:
- keyboard
- socket.py
- sys

To install all packages, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
